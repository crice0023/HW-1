# HW-1
## Project Description
Here we aim to find 2 COVID-19 raw datasets from an existing GitHub repository [https://github.com/crice0023/HW-1/tree/main/raw%20data]. Data sets were found and saved to a local computer. 
Then data sets were cleaned and merged in order to piece together a series of graphs, which will be explained later within the README file. 

##  Repository Organization
The folder structure can be found here [https://github.com/crice0023/HW-1/tree/main].
The structure looks exactly like this:

The first folder is the R Code necessary to recreate the analyst's efforts. Then follows the raw data folder so interested parties have easy access to the same raw data the analyst used. 
Subsequent folders are the graphic images the data analyst produced. 

b. explain the organization of the repo (folder structure, where they can find the data and scripts,
what were the steps in creating the report)
c. main findings where you include the three graphs and a sentence or two on their interpretation
d. session info to help with reproducibility
